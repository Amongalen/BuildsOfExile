      perpetuity.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4><strong><a class="anchor" id="cookies">4. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</a></strong></h4>

  <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your
    information.</em></p>

  <p>We may use cookies to store information.
    Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our
    Cookies Policy: <a href="{% url 'cookie_policy' %}">{% fullurl 'cookie_policy' %}</a>.
  </p>

  <h4><strong><a class="anchor" id="sociallogins">5. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</a></strong></h4>

  <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> If you choose to register or log in to our services using a social media account, we
    may have access to
    certain information about you.</em></p>

  <p>Our Website offers you the ability to register and login using your third-party social media account details (like
    your Facebook or Google logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you
    from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider
    concerned, but will often include your name, email address, profile picture as well as other
    information
    you choose to make public on such social media platform.</p>

  <p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that are
    otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Website. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible
    for,
    other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review
    their
    privacy notice to understand how they collect, use and share your personal information, and how you can set your
    privacy preferences on their sites and apps.</p>


  <h4><strong><a class="anchor" id="inforetain">6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</a></strong></h4>

  <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined
    in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>

  <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy
    notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal
    requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the
    period
    of time in which users have an account with us.</p>

  <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
    anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
    stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
    processing until deletion is possible.</p>


  <h4><strong><a class="anchor" id="infosafe">7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</a></strong></h4>

  <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and
    technical security
    measures.</em></p>

  <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of
    any
    personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no
    electronic
    transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot
    promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat
    our
    security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect
    your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Website is at your own risk. You
    should only access the Website within a secure environment.</p>

  <h4><strong><a class="anchor" id="privacyrights">8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</a></strong></h4>

  <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA) and United Kingdom (UK),
    you have rights that
    allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your
    account at any time.</em></p>

  <p>In some regions (like the EEA and UK), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may
    include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request
    rectification
    or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data
    portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal
    information. To make such a request, please use the contact details provided below. We will consider and act upon
    any
    request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>

  <p>If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent
    at
    any time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal, nor
    will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other
    than consent.
    If you are a resident in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you
    also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact
    details here: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm">https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm</a>.

  <h5><strong>Account Information</strong></h5>

  <p>If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you
    can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Contact us using the contact information provided.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our
    active
    databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with
    any investigations, enforce our Terms of Use and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.</p>

  <p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong> Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you
    prefer, you can
    usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or
    reject
    cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Website. For further information, please see our
    Cookies
    Policy: <a href="{% url 'cookie_policy' %}">{% fullurl 'cookie_policy' %}</a>.</p>

  <h4><strong><a class="anchor" id="DNT">9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</a></strong></h4>

  <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature
    or
    setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities
    monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
    has
    been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
    automatically
    communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow
    in
    the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>

  <h4><strong><a class="anchor" id="caresidents">10. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</a></strong>
  </h4>

  <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding
    access to your personal
    information.</em></p>

  <p>You may contact us by email at <a href="mailto:guidetoexile@gmail.com">guidetoexile@gmail.com</a>, or by referring
    to the contact details at the bottom of this
    document.</p>

  <p>If you are using an authorized agent to exercise your right to opt-out we may deny a request if the authorized
    agent
    does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf.</p>

  <p><strong>Will your information be shared with anyone else?</strong></p>

  <p>We may disclose your personal information with our service providers pursuant to a written contract between us and
    each service provider. Each service provider is a for-profit entity that processes the information on our
    behalf.</p>

  <p>We may use your personal information for our own business purposes, such as for undertaking internal research for
    technological development and demonstration. This is not considered to be "selling" of your personal data.</p>

  <p>Guide to Exile has not disclosed or sold any personal information to third parties for a business or commercial
    purpose in the preceding 12 months. Guide to Exile will not sell personal information in the future belonging to
    website visitors, users and other consumers.</p>

  <p><strong>Your rights with respect to your personal data</strong></p>

  <p><u>Right to request deletion of the data - Request to delete</u></p>

  <p>You can ask for the deletion of your personal information. If you ask us to delete your personal information, we
    will
    respect your request and delete your personal information, subject to certain exceptions provided by law, such as
    (but
    not limited to) the exercise by another consumer of his or her right to free speech, our compliance requirements
    resulting from a legal obligation or any processing that may be required to protect against illegal activities.</p>

  <p><u>Right to be informed - Request to know</u></p>

  <p>Depending on the circumstances, you have a right to know:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>whether we collect and use your personal information;</li>
    <li>the categories of personal information that we collect;</li>
    <li>the purposes for which the collected personal information is used;</li>
    <li>whether we sell your personal information to third parties;</li>
    <li>the categories of personal information that we sold or disclosed for a business purpose;</li>
    <li>the categories of third parties to whom the personal information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose;
      and
    </li>
    <li>the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In accordance with applicable law, we are not obligated to provide or delete consumer information that is
    de-identified in response to a consumer request or to re-identify individual data to verify a consumer request.</p>

  <p><u>Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights</u></p>

  <p>We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.</p>

  <p><u>Verification process</u></p>

  <p>Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom
    we
    have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that
    we
    can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you
    submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the
    information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g. phone or email) that
    you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.</p>

  <p>We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the
    request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of
    verification. If, however, we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may
    request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity, and for security or
    fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying
    you.</p>

  <p><u>Other privacy rights</u></p>
  <ul>
    <li>you may object to the processing of your personal data</li>
    <li>you may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to restrict
      the processing of the data
    </li>
    <li>you can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a request
      from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf
      in accordance with the CCPA.
    </li>
    <li>you may request to opt-out from future selling of your personal information to third parties. Upon receiving a
      request to opt-out, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than 15 days from the
      date of the request submission.
    </li>
